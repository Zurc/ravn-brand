          <h2>RAVN's Story</h2>
          <p>When Norse explorers set out in their longboats to discover new land, they would sometimes take a few ravens with them. The raven is a land-based bird, so after one is released it would ascend to great altitude, but always return to the boat if there was no land in sight. If the raven spots land however, it would set its course for it and guide the explorers to new land. This is how the first settlers navigated to Iceland.</p>
          <p>We are the ravens of the information technology industry, the RAVN. Guiding our clients to their destination in the ever expanding sea of information is our speciality and passion.</p>
