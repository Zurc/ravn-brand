			<h2>Typesetting Guides</h2>
			<p>Left alignement provides the eye with a constant starting point for each line, making text easier to read for the user.</p>
			<p>For headlines, the leading should be 15% larger than the typesize. To calculate, multiply the typesize by .15 and add the result to the typesize.</p>
			<p>When setting body text, the leading should be 25% larger than the typesize. To calculate this, multiply the type size by .25 and add the result to the typesize</p>
			<p>NOTE: leading ( /ˈlɛdɪŋ/) refers to the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type.</p>
