# ravn-brand
website for brand guidelines. 

This is a Responsive website who integrates both Bootstrap and PHP CodeIgniter.
The idea came after creating RAVN Systems Brand Guidelines 
as a way to make it easier for anyone to access and download material if necessary.

This is an example to show the potential of an offcanvas layout pattern in Bootstrap. 
(Try some responsive-range viewport sizes to see it in action)
Also this is a good example of PHP dynamic templates as you can see on the sidebar of the home page.

Main Reference an idea: Mozilla.org
